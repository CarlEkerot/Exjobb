\title{Automatic Structural Inference of Binary Protocols}
\author{Fredrik Appelros \and Carl Ekerot}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Communication protocols are the foundation of everyday networking tasks but
they are not always open in terms of available documentation. For reasons of
interoperability or the collection of statistics some protocols need to be
reverse engineered. This thesis presents a method based on density-based
clustering and byte distribution classification for automatically inferring the
structure of a protocol from a packet dump. We evaluate the precision of the
method for finding different packet types and for finding fields, both globally
across all packets and within the inferred packet types.
