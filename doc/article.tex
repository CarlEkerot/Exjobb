\title{Automatic Structural Inference of Binary Protocols}
\author{Fredrik Appelros \and Carl Ekerot}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Communication protocols are the foundation of everyday networking tasks but
they are not always open in terms of available documentation. For reasons of
interoperability or the collection of statistics some protocols need to be
reverse engineered. This article presents a method based on density-based
clustering and byte distribution classification for automatically inferring the
structure of a protocol from a packet dump. We evaluate the precision of the
method for finding different packet types and for finding fields globally
across all packets.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The languages computers use when communicating are defined in network protocols.
Some of these protocols, like HTTP, are text-based but a large portion of them
are binary. Text-based protocols use messages that are easy for humans to
understand as they can simply be read while binary ones are much harder to
interpret. Binary protocols consist of a large chunk of binary data with no
clear distinction between the different parts. However, each protocol usually
has a documentation that explains how to interpret this data; a definition of
the different fields that the data chunks are made up of. A field is a set of
bits that represent some kind of information. It can be a flag, a number, a
string or just raw data.

Unfortunately, this documentation is not always available. The protocol might
be proprietary or simply undocumented, making it hard for third parties to use.
For interoperability or quality of service reasons the demand to understand
these protocols still exists. This is where protocol reverse engineering steps
in. Protocol reverse engineering is the art of deducing the syntax and
semantics of a protocol by analyzing its communication.

\section{Method}
The approach we used is based on analysis of packet dumps, i.e. a collection
of captured messages. The first step was to find the different message types.
After this was done we focused on finding different types of fields; both
common for all types and unique fields within types. Lastly, we also
constructed a state diagram for the protocol to get an overview of the
transitions between different message types.

\subsection{Type inference}
The first part was done with the help of a density-based clustering algorithm
called \emph{OPTICS}. What this step does is group similar messages together into
\emph{clusters}. The similarity of the messages are defined as the euclidean
distance between them in a feature-space. For our features we chose the
observed probability of the current byte value occurring at the current
position for each position in the message. This works fairly well but becomes
cumbersome as the feature-space will be $n$-dimensional where $n$ is the size
of the largest message. To circumvent this we apply
\emph{principal component analysis} (PCA) on all our features to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem.

This yields a fairly good result but it can still be improved upon. We further
assume that this initial clustering is mostly homogeneous, i.e. most clusters
only contain messages of a single type. We also assume that there is some set
of bytes in the message that indicates what type it is. We call these bytes
\emph{type distinguishers}. We then refine our clustering by finding the bytes
that are most likely to be type distinguishers and grouping messages together
depending on the values of these bytes. The most likely candidates are found by
measuring how high the \emph{completeness} for the clusters becomes if they are
grouped together by the value of that specific byte. Completeness is a metric
that describes how spread out the different message types are. If all messages
of each specific type is located in a single cluster the completeness becomes
one while on the other hand if all messages are located in different clusters
it becomes zero. In most clusterings the completeness value falls somewhere
in between zero and one. With the type distinguishers and, therefore, the
message types found we move on to the next step; finding the fields.

\subsection{Field inference}
When inferring the fields we start by defining a set of field types that we
deem identifiable, e.g. length fields, flags and constants. We then go through
all possible aligned field positions of different lengths and try to match them
to one of these types. This is done for different scopes of our packet dump in
order to find fields present in all messages as well as fields only present in
certain types.

For some of the more basic types, like flags and constants, it is sufficient to
look at the distribution of byte values for each byte of the potential field in
order to determine the field type. The distribution are constructed from all
the messages in the current scope. For more complex types a deeper analysis is
needed. A good example is length fields for which we do a robust form of linear
regression to see if we can find some linear dependency between the value in
the field and the lengths of the messages.

Once we have all the possible field types for all possible aligned field
positions we merge them together into a unified definition. The merging works
on a set of precedences for the types in order to remove overlapping fields.

\subsection{State inference}
For our state diagram we only want a simple overview of the first few states
of the protocol. Because of this we have a parameter that limits the diagram to
a number of transitions from the start state. The diagram itself is constructed
by building a pair of transition matrices from the connections in the packet
dump. Each inferred message type is considered a state and sequential messages
are seen as state transitions. Using these matrices it is trivial to produce a
state diagram for the protocol. An example of such a diagram is seen in
figure~\ref{fig:smbstate}.
